 - **4 clickable color coded encoders**
 - **1W Audio amplifier** for the internal speaker
 - **Battery management and charging** circuit for the lipo/li-ion batteries and a led battery meter  
 - **Gpio breakout** to allow to position the Raspberry rotated 90 degrees to access the USB ports and to easely use both the LCD screen and the audio card.
